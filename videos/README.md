Here we show videos rotating our predicted 3D poses alongside the ground-truth 3D pose.

Our predicted 3D poses are multi-coloured with the key-points predicted being in blue.
The ground-truth 3D poses are in green with the ground truth key-points being in red.

Additionally we provide the image that the ground truth 3D pose corresponds to. 

- Videos 1-8 show our 3D reconstruction against the ground truth when there is no occlusion present. These were chosen as they help highlight the most common reconstruction error which are mainly due to incorrect wrist and elbow key-points due to their high degrees of freedom. 

We are not shy about the mistakes are model can make as unsupervised 2D-3D lifting is a highly difficult task and welcome any improvement that may come from highlighting these errors.

- Video 9 shows our reconstruction when we assume the left arm is occluded
- Video 10 shows our reconstruction when we assume the right arm is occluded
- Video 11 shows our reconstruction when we assume the right leg is occluded
- Video 12 shows our reconstruction when we assume the left leg is occluded
- Video 13 shows our reconstruction when we assume the both legs are occluded
- Video 14 shows our reconstruction when we assume the full torso is occluded.
